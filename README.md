# recipeManager

Initial Feedback Written Description.

We are planning on building a recipe manager application. It will allow different users who use the application to find, create, and track recipes.

Each recipe is associated with a user.

The application will include four screens:

# Home Screen

The home screen is where you can find recipes. It will include all recipes and have a way of searching for recipes.

# Users Screen

The users screen will include all users that use the application. The users are local to the app, so everyone who uses the phone, such as in a family, will have their own user. On the users screen, you can create a new user, or click on a user. If you click on a user, you will be taken to the User-Recipes screen.

# Profile screen

The profile screen is how you can view the recipes of a specific user.

# Create Recipe Screen

The create recipe screen allows you to create a new recipe associated with a user.

Recipes include an associated user. A potential image. A title name. A list of ingrediants with potential portions. And instructions.
